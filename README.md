# Machine Learning of Chebyshev Coefficients in the Kernel Polynomial Method

The Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM), see this [review](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.78.275), allows efficient (linear) calculation of spectral quantities by expanding them into Chebyshev coefficients.

This repository contains code to directly predict the Chebyshev coefficients for nanoflakes directly from geometric data, which allows to further accelerate the performance of this method and perhaps unify with existing ab initio approaches.
